I'm a last year undergraduate student from [School of AI, Beijing Normal University](https://ai.bnu.edu.cn/), and a 2026 Ph.D student in [School of Software Technology，Zhejiang Universuty](http://www.cst.zju.edu.cn/main.htm). My research interest includes LLM and RAG, 

(https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
